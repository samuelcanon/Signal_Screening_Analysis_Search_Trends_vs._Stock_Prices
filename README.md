# Correlation Analysis 
**Overview**
This project tests whether publicly available online attention (Google Trends search volume and Wikipedia page views) show a lead relationship with weekly stock returns for four large cap stocks (TSLA, NVDA, META, JPM) over a three year period (Jan 2022 to Dec 2024). Three independent data sources were cleaned, aligned to a weekly calendar, and tested at a pre-registered one week lag against a business action bar.

The result is a clean null. None of the eight tests (4 stocks x 2 attention sources) showed a correlation strong enough to act on. The available data did not reliably precede price movement for these stocks in this period. 

This is a correlation and lag analysis study.

## Business Context


|No-go||r| < 0.20|Explains under 4% of return movement — not worth pursuing|
|Investigate|0.20 <= |r| < 0.40|Worth a closer look|
|Go||r| >= 0.40 | Strong enough to build on|
